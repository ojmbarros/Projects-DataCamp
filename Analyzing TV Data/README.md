# Analyzing TV Data

This project will analyze the Super Bowl Data, generating insights into game outcomes, viewership, and even halftime shows.

The motive for doing this project was to reinforce my skills in Data Manipulation and Python use.

This analysis is to reply to the following questions:

  What are the most extreme game outcomes?
  How does the game affect television viewership?
  How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
  Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
