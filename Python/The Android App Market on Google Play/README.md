# The Android App Market on Google Play

Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative and due to that, more and more apps are being developed. The Android app market will be analyzed by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. This project will look for insights into the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

The motive for doing this project was to reinforce my skills in Joining Data with pandas in Python.
