# The GitHub history of the Scala Language

Open source projects contain entire development histories, such as who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. In this project, you'll be challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language.

The dataset includes the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.

The motive for doing this project was to reinforce my skills in Joining Data with pandas.
