# Which Debts Are Worth the Bank's Effort?

After a debt has been legally declared "uncollectable" by a bank, the account is considered to be "charged-off." But that doesn't mean the bank walks away from the debt. They still want to collect some of the money they are owed. This project aims to determine  whether the incremental amount the bank earns exceeds the additional cost of assigning customers to a higher recovery strategy by a non-random assignment.

Threshold assignments like this also occur in medicine (above a certain temperature you get medicine), education (above a certain test score students get admitted to a special class), other areas of finance (above a certain wealth customers get different levels of service), and public sector (below a certain income someone is eligible for housing benefits).

Regression discontinuity is an intuitive and useful analysis method in any situation of a threshold assignment.

The motive for doing this project was to reinforce my skills in Data Manipulation with pandas and Statistical Thinking in Python.
