# Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species

This project will analyze the information about penguins by utilizing unsupervised learning techniques on a thoughtfully curated dataset. uncover concealed patterns, clusters, and relationships that exist within the dataset.

The motive for doing this project was to reinforce my skills in Unsupervised Learning in Python.
