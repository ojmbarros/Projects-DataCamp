# Predictive Modeling for Agriculture

This project will analyze the data from a farmer to help him select the best crop for his field. Unfortunately, he could only afford to measure one out of the four essential soil measures:

Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
Phosphorous content ratio in the soil
Potassium content ratio in the soil
pH value of the soil

The motive for doing this project was to reinforce my skills in Supervised Learning with scikit-learn.
