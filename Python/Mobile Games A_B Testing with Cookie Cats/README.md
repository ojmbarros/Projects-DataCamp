# Mobile Games A/B Testing with Cookie Cats

Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic "connect three" style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and win the level. It also features singing cats.

As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase. This project aims to analyze the result of an A/B test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40 and analyze the impact on player retention.

TThe motive for doing this project was to reinforce my skills in Hypothesis Testing in Python.
