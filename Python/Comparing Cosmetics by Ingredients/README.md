# Comparing Cosmetics by Ingredients

Buying new cosmetic products is difficult. It can even be scary for those with sensitive skin and prone to skin trouble. The information needed to alleviate this problem is on the back of each product, but it is tough to interpret those ingredient lists unless you have a background in chemistry.

This project will use the ingredient lists for 1472 cosmetics on Sephora via word embedding, then visualize ingredient similarity using a machine learning method called t-SNE and an interactive visualization library called Bokeh.

The motive for doing this project was to reinforce my skills in Dimensionality Reduction in Python, Data Manipulation with pandas and Interactive Data Visualization with Bokeh.
